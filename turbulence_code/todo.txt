transitions
[OK]    - correct start/stop without click (tiny fade-in/out)
[--]    - kurven-verlauf
[--]    - concurrency? (FFTs)
[OK]    - step-functions (versus glissandi)
        - atk / rls -- could be dependent on type of transition

background
- asynchronous starting point

mellite
[OK]    - setting for auto-start sensors
[OK]    - in-memory variant (as backup)
[OK]    - obj view - should really update playing state of ensembles
[low]   - optionally disable meters

settings
- blockSize 128 relaxes the CPU quite a lot

[OK]    fsm - no.6 escaped (not mono)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

try `renice` scsynth

time pulse: like a "light" process, but use small high-feedback delays (similar to the effect that the XRUNS produce)

[OK]    - layer 1 - resonz (?) bricht aus schon bei 6 Hz
        - layer blips - longer decay 6 ?   max density  aus sensoren?
         ; rsdt - TOA Incident --- als modulator fuer decay/density ?

- blob had occasional spike in amplitude; perhaps clip input values if there are disk drop outs?
