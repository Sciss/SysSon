### Building from Source

The project is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) 2.12, 2.11 and builds with 
[sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). The included shell script `sbt` is sufficient to build the project as it will 
automatically download and locally install Scala and sbt.
First, open a terminal (bash), and go (`cd`) into the main project directory.

Then to build the project:

    $ ./sbt assembly

The resulting file is `SysSon.jar`.

Building cross-platform installer package:

    $ ./sbt universal:packageBin

Building Debian installer package:

    $ ./sbt debian:packageBin
